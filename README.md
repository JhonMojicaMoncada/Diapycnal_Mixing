# Diapycnal_Mixing V1
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/814694978.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11639017)

Matlab code to calculate diapycnal mixing rates in polar areas.
I include the code and as example one data station for reference. The idea is to reply it for a whole dataset.
The more data include it, the more robust will be the analysis.
